# A Study in Conversational Machine Comprehension

Conversational Question Answering (CoQA) is a challenging Machine Reading
Comprehension (MRC) problem under Natural language processing (NLP). In this
report, we investigated various SOTA models, especially ALBERT based models,
to improve its evaluation performance on the CoQA datasets. We aim to fine-tune
and compare their respective performance via hands-on implementation and qualitative
and quantitative analysis. Our final ALBERT + AT (Adversarial Training)
plus Auxiliary Tasks (Ensemble) model trained with extra data achieved the highest
evaluation score among other models and the benchmark.
